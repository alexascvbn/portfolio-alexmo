            project with E-commerce car parts app. It is good practice which has
            strengthened my coding skills, team spirit with my classmates in
            understanding clientâ€™s needs, programing structures and application

            the react native mobile apps. It is my starting point to realize the
            advantages of react.js or react native.

            to enhance my coding sense and skills. I am studied the online
            course from mosh and following him step by step to make the real
            react native app project, Finally, I am looking the new jobs and
